I must point out though that I merely saw this as an ideal excuse to learn how to use [AndEngine][1] rather than flood Google Play with [malware][3]. Incidently my clone (along with almost every other) was [removed][4] by Google rather swiftly! \r\n\r\nAnyway, in my pursuit of creating the perfect Flappy Bird clone I could find numerous fragmented tutorials, snippets and documentation but I found it frustratingly difficult to find actual examples of real, finished games that were open source - working code is after all the very best form of documentation. \r\n\r\nSo, here is my slightly-rough-around-the-edges attempt to reproduce one of the most annoying yet popular games ever to hit mobile devices - I hope it can help some others to get to grips with game development on Android.\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n--------\r\nFirst check out the source of [AndEngine][5], add it to your Eclipse workspace as an Android library project. Check out the source for OpenFlappyBird and add it to your workspace - hopefully the reference to AndEngine should be ok if you have them both in the same directory. If not just remove the broken reference and add it again.\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n--------\r\n  - Never did manage to finish the scoreboard stuff\r\n  - Gradle-a-fy all teh things!\r\n  - Maybe tidy things up, this was slapped together in 2 about evenings!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: http://www.andengine.org/\r\n[2]: https://play.google.com/store/search?q=flappy%20bird\r\n[3]: http://uk.pcmag.com/news/33567/nearly-80-percent-of-flappy-bird-clones-contained\r\n[4]: http://i.imgur.com/bJSoYYI.png\r\n[5]: https://github.com/nicolasgramlich/AndEngine\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
