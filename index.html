<p>An open source clone of a famous flappy bird game for Android using the amazing <a href="http://www.andengine.org/">AndEngine</a></p>

<a name="history" class="anchor" href="#history"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History</h2>

<p>When the original Flappy Bird game was removed from Google Play (and other well known app marketplaces), I, along with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=flappy%20bird">thousands</a> of other unimaginative developers rushed to fill that void with our own crappy rip off clones. I must point out though that I merely saw this as an ideal excuse to learn how to use <a href="http://www.andengine.org/">AndEngine</a> rather than flood Google Play with <a href="http://uk.pcmag.com/news/33567/nearly-80-percent-of-flappy-bird-clones-contained">malware</a>. Incidently my clone (along with almost every other) was <a href="http://i.imgur.com/bJSoYYI.png">removed</a> by Google rather swiftly! </p>

<p>Anyway, in my pursuit of creating the perfect Flappy Bird clone I could find numerous fragmented tutorials, snippets and documentation but I found it frustratingly difficult to find actual examples of real, finished games that were open source - working code is after all the very best form of documentation. </p>

<p>So, here is my slightly-rough-around-the-edges attempt to reproduce one of the most annoying yet popular games ever to hit mobile devices - I hope it can help some others to get to grips with game development on Android.</p>

<a name="instructions" class="anchor" href="#instructions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Instructions</h2>

<p>First check out the source of <a href="https://github.com/nicolasgramlich/AndEngine">AndEngine</a>, add it to your Eclipse workspace as an Android library project. Check out the source for OpenFlappyBird and add it to your workspace - hopefully the reference to AndEngine should be ok if you have them both in the same directory. If not just remove the broken reference and add it again.</p>
